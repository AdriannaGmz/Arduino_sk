After writting complete new image, connect to monitor and usb mouse and keyboard, enable all options in raspberry pi Configuration (meaning SSH, VNC). Change of password is required for pi user
old password: raspberry
new password: raspberry0.


#### Connecting with ethernet
https://itsfoss.com/how-to-find-what-devices-are-connected-to-network-in-ubuntu/

Plug with ethernet cable to linux (asus)

in linux asus we should have nmap already installed.  and have the ethernet port as shared in ipv4
to get ip address provided by ethernet port, first
$ ifconfig

which gives: 
enp2s0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 10:c3:7b:1b:b5:a9  
          inet addr:10.42.0.1  Bcast:10.42.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::bb24:9dea:fd41:1c45/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:298 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:363 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0

          RX bytes:28251 (28.2 KB)  TX bytes:62590 (62.5 KB)

Then, to scan all devices connectedto this network
adrianna@asusUbuntu:~/Documents/PDP_AaltoExp$ sudo nmap -sn 10.42.0.0/24
[sudo] password for adrianna:

then, open vnc Viewer to 10.42.0.125
